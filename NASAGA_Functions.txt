Functions:

1) scoreRun
	This function takes in the score.txt file that is created by the G4BeamLine (symulation) and fix any
	possible errors such as x^x vs x^y and convert the data to a simular power. This is done to add a dimention
	to the dataset array. It will copy the top % to be parents of the array to start a new generation.

2) dataDraw
	Opens data.txt and loads it into an array for reading and prints out
	I used this to warn for errors

3) arrayFilter
	creates the new array based off the score data to create the new parents

4) arrayRand
	Takes the most updated array and adds itself ontop till the array is filled. This is just stacking the top %
	all the way down the array.

5) arrayFill
	This function will use the parent data and will randomly change a random ammount of data in the most updated
	array. This is then tested to see if it fits within the dementions allowed till the new dataset is full of
	of new data.

6) fileBuild
	Builds a .txt file that can be put into the simulation to test and create a new score file

7) rand_doubble_int
	Makes a random number that can be accepted by the arrayRand function
